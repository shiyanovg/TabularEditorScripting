# TabularEditorScripting
This is repository was inspired by the creator of Tabular Editor (Daniel Otykier) and his article about scripting with Tabular Editor
You may use any of this scripts on your Tabular Models on Power BI model but keep in mind that not all of the scripts will work directly against Power BI Desktop.
But if you have an access to XMLA-endpoint (read/write mode) you can use one of this sctipts in your enviroment.

List for support against Power BI Desktop (stay tuned)
